# OneMind
OneMind is an app designed to help you figure out what bad habits you have that affect your happiness

Working on this project helped me understand event listeners, and understand where Kotlin is used.

OneMind is a very simple app at the moment, It only tells you a general idea of where you are with your bad habits.OneMind
There is one screen that has questions and progress bars, when you submit your answer's to the program it calculates,
(how many times you perform the good habit)/(total times you've performed habits)

## Purpose for this app
I really wanted to experiment with creating a mobile app. Seeing how easy it can be gives me some confidence
to use this knowledge going forward!

## Development Environment
I used Android Studio and Kotlin to create my app
Android Studio is incredibly nice, it seems to do a lot of the work for you which got me in trouble
when I was attempting to create buttons but once I figured out what was really needed it became much
simpler.

Kotlin is a very nice language that is very succinct in it's typing and I enjoy writing in it

    * For onClickListener it made my life a lot easier and was simple to understand
* [Android Developers Documentation](https://developer.android.com/docs)
    * Basically a necessity for anything in Android Studio

## Future Work
* Make the button's go away once they've been clicked
* Make the Progress bar be more dynamic and not wait for the submit button
* Add another screen to find the history of your progress
